5.	Using SourceTree clone repository locally
6.	Cut PSD from landing_page.psd.zip into HTML and import it in Visual Studio Solution contained in Solution folder
7.	If you need help with ASP.NET implementation take a look at Solution\AspNetTester\Project_Readme.html
8.	While working keep commiting to your repository so work history can be reviewed. Few rules regarding commits:
    - Atomic, descriptive commits instead of one huge commit – so:
        - Feature 1 commit 
        - Feature 2 commit 
        - Feature 3 commit 
    - And not:
       - Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3 in single commit
    - Obviously “Feature 1,2,3” is bad description – be descriptive in your explanation of commit
    - Commit needs to be atomic in a sense: do not commit if what you did breaks build
9.	Once you are done with implementation email link to your GitHub repository
